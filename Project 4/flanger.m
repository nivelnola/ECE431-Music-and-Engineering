% FUNCTION
%    [soundOut]=flanger(constants,inSound,depth,delay,width,LFO_Rate)
%
% This function creates the sound output from the flanger effect
%
% OUTPUTS
%   soundOut = The output sound vector
%
% INPUTS
%   constants   = the constants structure
%   inSound     = The input audio vector
%   depth       = depth setting in seconds
%   delay       = minimum time delay in seconds
%   width       = total variation of the time delay from the minimum to the maximum
%   LFO_Rate    = The frequency of the Low Frequency oscillator in Hz
